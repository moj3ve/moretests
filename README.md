# Squ1dd13's GitHub Repo
Currently, due to various issues, there are no packages in this repository. The packages will soon be added and the working repository files will be copied into a main repo folder.
# Why is it on GitHub now?
This GitHub repository is basically a workspace where I will be testing any changes to HTML and the workings of the repository. The actual repository will be where you download the tweaks from.
